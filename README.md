# Tanky

A html5 mutliplayer realtime game with http://colyseus.io as the backend and phaser.io as the game engine for the frontend.

## The game
Each player will control a tank on the battlefield. The players will drive their tank around trying to destroy the opponents tanks by firing shells at the tanks.

## Running the server

One very simple command: 
```shell
yarn watch:server
```
This will start the server and restart when any changes are made to the server.

## Building the client

One command: 
```shell
yarn watch:client
```
This will use webpack and watch the client src and rebuild on any changes
