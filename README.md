# Tanky

A html5 mutliplayer realtime game with node.js (using socket.io 👍) as the backend.

## The game
Each player will control a tank on the battlefield. The players will drive their tank around trying to destroy the opponents tanks by firing shells at the tanks.

## Running the server

One very simple command (using gulp 😉): 
```shell
gulp
```
This will build the server and client and start the server.
