## Overview
Tanky is a multiplayer topdown tank shooter. Each player will control one tank and fire shells at other players to destroy their tank.

## Gameplay Example
The player's tank spawns in the map when he connects to the server. He then drives his tank using either the on-screen touch controls, WASD or Arrow Keys. The player sees an enemy tank on the screen and rotates his turret in the direction of the enemy tank by using either the mouse or on-screen controls. He then lauches a shell at the other tank by using the spacebar, left clicking or the on-screen controls. The enemy tank now loses health...

The player is now low on health after destroying the enemy tank in a hard fought battle. He drives around the map avoiding enemies while his health is slowly restored.
